    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) President Donald Trump is touring the storm damage of San Juan and hearing the stories of residents still recovering from Hurricane Maria.\r\nThe president is visiting neighborhoods and has told one resident that the governor and the mayor are \"doing a good job.\"\r\nRecently, San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz criticized the pace of the federal government's response and drew Trump's scorn.\r\nThe president's visit included meetings with her and other local officials. As he left the airport, the president's motorcade snaked through streets lined with downed tree limbs, mangled signs and drooping power lines. A beach was covered in debris.\r\nScattered groups of people gathered to watch the motorcade pass. One held a sign reading, \"Climate change is real.\" Another's said: \"You are a bad hombre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3f54007ceca1d6c2dccb427a705b990f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
