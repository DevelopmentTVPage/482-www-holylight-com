    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Students in Barcelona were on Tuesday protesting against the use of force by Spanish authorities in preventing a disputed referendum on Catalan secession. \r\nHundreds of people were injured in the violence on Sunday.\r\nOn Tuesday, highways were blocked, schools closed and much business halted across Catalonia as workers and students joined strikes and took to the streets.\r\nIn Barcelona, where bus and subway services were affected, disoriented tourists scrambled to find open cafeterias eluding the protests.\r\nThe protests came as several labour unions and grassroots pro-independence groups had urged workers throughout Catalonia to go on partial or full-day strikes and as the region's leaders ponder a how to proceed with a declaration of independence, two days after the referendum that turned violent and that Madrid deemed illegal and invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a05bd05a44ee31c11b001dd0e1faf20f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
