    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Some injuries are as simple as broken bones, others gunshot wounds involving multiple surgeries and potential transplants, and all come with the added emotional scars of enduring the deadliest shooting in modern U.S. history, with 59 killed. \r\nAt least 130 people remained hospitalized on Tuesday, with 48 listed in critical condition. \r\nHospitals said 185 others had already been released. \r\nSunrise Hospital in Las Vegas, for instance shared the count with another area hospital for the treatment of 120 victims who were struck by gunfire; a mere glimpse of the amount of ammunition unleashed in the attack. \r\nJustin Burton, who was shot twice in the back, and Mike Kordich, were both treated at Sunrise.\r\nBurton got to go home on Tuesday, but Kordich will stay for observation until doctors can determine if he needs another surgery on his arm. \r\nKordich, a firefighter, was giving CPR to a severely injured person at the concert when he was hit in the arm by a bullet. \r\n\"I kept doing chest compressions with one arm until I noticed I was starting to bleed a lot,\" Kordich recalled. He ran for cover, jumping fences, and said he could hear the bullets whizzing by.\r\nRehabilitation for the most seriously hurt victims will take far longer than many may realize.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/59bc175b3615e65fbc36a6f5706f6bfe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
