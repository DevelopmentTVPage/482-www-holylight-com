    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Hundreds of performers carried a giant fire dragon through the streets of Hong Kong on Wednesday as part of the Mid-Autumn festival, the modern version of the old harvest festival.\r\nThe performers carried the 67-metre (220 feet) long fire dragon studded with burning incense sticks and danced with the crowds in the small streets of Tai Hang district.\r\nThe ritual dates back to the 19th century when the giant fire dragon was used to defeat a plague, according to tradition.\r\nIt became an annual event held for three days from the eve of the Mid-Autumn festival.\r\nThousands of tourists and local residents gather to celebrate.\r\nThe Tai Hang fire dragon was listed as part of China's intangible cultural heritage in 2011.  \r\nThe Mid-Autumn festival, also known as the Moon Festival, falls on 4 October this year - the night of the full moon.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8b85c955e96b2bb5ba74c6888b0742b2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
