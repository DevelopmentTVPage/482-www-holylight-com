    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who favors gun control, said Tuesday that \"the epidemic of gun violence is a uniquely American problem.\" \r\nHe spoke at a news conference on Capitol Hill with other Democratic Senators, urging Congress to take action on gun control, saying \"enough is enough.\" \r\n\"It doesn't happen in any other industrialized country,\" Sen. Murphy said, \"and It's because this country has the loosest set of gun laws allowing dangerous people to own dangerous weapons in the industrialized world.\"\r\nBut even as Democratic leaders pressed for action, none was expected, as other mass shootings in Colorado, Connecticut, and Florida, and even attacks on Gifford and Scalise, failed to unite Congress on any legislative response. A bipartisan bill on background checks failed in the Senate four years ago, and since then Republicans have usually pointed to mental health legislation when questioned about the appropriate congressional response to gun violence.\r\nThe complicated politics of guns was personified by West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat up for re-election next year in a state carried overwhelmingly by President Donald Trump.\r\nManchin, who co-sponsored the failed bill that would have expanded background checks, said Tuesday, \"I come from a gun state and I am a protector of Second Amendment rights and I understand these people's fear.\"\r\nWest Virginia residents \"cherish the right to be able to go hunting with their family ... sport shooting and all the things we do enjoy,\" Manchin said, adding that any potential legislation must be based in common sense.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/66e55e5958469ba7962eda06bfbacac3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
