    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) A Las Vegas shooter's perch in a 32nd-floor hotel room overlooking 22,000 people jammed into a country music festival below is just the kind of nightmare scenario police dread in places where big crowds and high-rises mix.\r\nFrom two broken-out windows of the Mandalay Bay Resort, Stephen Craig Paddock had an unobstructed view to rain rapid-fire bullets on the crowd, with few places for them to hide. Survivors of Sunday night's bloodbath that left 59 people dead and more than 500 wounded repeatedly compared it to shooting fish in a barrel.\r\nIn places like New York, Chicago and Austin, Texas, where big events are planned in city streets in the coming days, police sought to reassure jittery residents of some of the precautions they are taking to prevent just such a scenario.\r\nDavid Katz, the CEO of Global Security Group says police are generally prepared for responding to snipers at major events, but in smaller situations he says a massive response is usually not feasible for law enforcement.\r\nBut if an active-shooter situation does arise, Katz says there are ways to protect yourself.\r\n\"Generally they would run away from the shooter which is not the best idea, unless you're running to close cover. Why? Because you're not going to outrun a bullet. As long as the shooter has a line of sight, you run the risk of being hit. It's counterintuitive to run back toward the building where the shooter was firing from,\" said Katz.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6e9dc455b9a36ee7f0f7d7888f1ad649 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
