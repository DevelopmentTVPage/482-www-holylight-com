    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) The spokesperson for the pro-unionist Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) said on Wednesday that the regional parliament's socialist group is preparing an appeal against the actions of the pro-separatist government to present to the Spanish Constitutional Court.\r\nCatalonia's regional government said on Wednesday it is preparing to declare the region's independence from Spain following Sunday's contested referendum, with some lawmakers saying it would happen as soon as Monday, 9 October. \r\nAs Spain grappled with its most serious national crisis in decades, a top EU official said Spain and Catalonia must talk with each other, even if Catalonia broke the law with an illegal referendum on independence.\r\nCatalonia's regional president, Carles Puigdemont, who has said an independence declaration will come in a few days, is delivering a televised speech later on Wednesday. \r\nSpain, which has declared Sunday's referendum illegal and invalid, is bitterly opposed to any independence move.\r\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government has said it will respond with \"all necessary measures\" to counter Catalan defiance, and is holding talks with opposition leaders in Madrid to forge a consensus over what to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/922d15d4f80f1bee7e44cb92d59f2508 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
