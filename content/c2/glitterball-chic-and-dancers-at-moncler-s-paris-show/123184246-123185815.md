    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) GLITTERBALL CHIC AND DANCERS AT MONCLER'S PARIS SHOW\r\nMoncler Gamme Rouge's Spring-Summer 2018 collection took its cue from a group of dancers in Chicago, the Hiplet Ballerinas, who combine hip hop and other dance styles with ballet.\r\nThey opened the show at the Grand Palais in Paris on Tuesday (3OCT17) with an exuberant dance on pointe, in a decor of sparkling disco balls.\r\nDesigner Giambattista Valli chose the theme after seeing a video of the dancers on social media, then creating a collection midway between ballet and sportswear. \r\nMaxi short shorts, grey leg warmers and ballerina flats or long transparent tutus were mashed up with large pale pink puffy jackets, tennis-like skirts, and jumpers loosely tied around the waist.\r\n\"The story (behind the collection) is about hiplet,\" explains Valli.\r\n\"It's like this courant between hip hop and ballet, and I love this idea because there is this kind of dynamic, idea of sport by feminine in a way and the other way, there is the ballet, that is something very French, very classical. So I love to mix the two worlds like Giambattista Valli and Moncler.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a55266e26d536db66b0407de894f0def \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
