    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) The leader of the People's Party of Catalonia has asked Catalans who do not agree with Catalonia's independence drive to come out onto the streets en masse on Sunday \"to defend democracy, freedom and the dignity of Catalans and Spaniards as a whole.\"\r\nXavier Garcia Albiol said Wednesday \"a part of Catalan society who did not take part in last Sunday's illegal referendum has said enough is enough (...) and is not willing to let others take away their feeling of belonging to a project that is our nation, our country and Spain.\"\r\nAlbiol said the television address by Spain's King Felipe VI on Tuesday where he said the Spanish state needs to ensure constitutional order and the rule of law in Catalonia had given unionists \"the most strength and energy to continue fighting for the defence of this feeling that the great majority of Catalans have, and that is to feel deeply Catalan but also very proud of our country and our homeland which is Spain.\"\r\nMeanwhile Catalonia's regional government is mulling when to declare the region's independence from Spain in the wake of a disputed referendum that has triggered Spain's most serious national crisis in decades.\r\nThe region's pro-independence president, Carles Puigdemont, who has said an independence declaration will come in a few days, is due to deliver a speech later Wednesday.\r\nSpain, which declared Sunday's referendum illegal and invalid, is bitterly opposed to any independence move. \r\nSpain's conservative government has said it will respond with \"all necessary measures\" to counter Catalan defiance, and is holding talks with opposition leaders to forge a consensus over what to do in response.\r\nCatalonia says some 2.3 million people - less than half the region's electorate - voted in the referendum. \r\nMany of those opposed to independence are thought to have stayed at home after the referendum was deemed illegal by Spanish courts. \r\nOf those who voted, some 90 percent voted yes to independence.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c9ed698d2b3de2d7f3f671a2050a087f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
