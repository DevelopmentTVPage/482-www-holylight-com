    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Thousands of Romanian public sector workers have rallied outside government offices in Bucharest on Wednesday to demand that the government scrap plans to hike the taxes paid by employees.\r\nProtesters blew whistles, yelled \"Romania, wake up!\" and called for the resignation of Prime Minister Mihai Tudose and other key ministers.\r\nWorkers from the health care sector, the national railways and other sectors took part in the demonstration, organized by the Alfa-Cartel trade union.\r\nOne factory worker said his salary is not enough to live on.\r\nUnder the new plan, social welfare taxes currently paid by the employer would be transferred to the employee.  Unions say the measure would reduce employees' net income by at least 8 percent.\r\nPolice closed Victory Square where the government has its main offices for the demonstration, snarling traffic in the Romanian capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/68c112734932ab97de5f4816b900b21b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
