    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Outcast North Korean scion Kim Jong Nam had extremely low levels of an enzyme vital for nervous system function in his body due to poisoning, a Malaysian government pathologist testified on Tuesday at the trial of two women accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim's face in a brazen airport assassination.\r\nBlood tests on the two murder suspects showed they had normal enzyme levels, said chemical pathologist Nur Ashikin Othman on the second day of their trial in Malaysia's High Court.\r\nThe potency of VX depends on the dosage or concentration, the type and duration of exposure and whether decontamination measures such as washing hands or taking an antidote were made, she added.\r\nGooi Soon Seng, the lawyer for Indonesian Siti Aisyah, told reporters the normal enzyme levels supported their assertion that the two women were not exposed to VX.\r\nSiti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam pleaded not guilty as their trial opened on Monday in the killing of Kim, widely thought to have been orchestrated by his half brother, North Korea's third-generation leader Kim Jong Un. \r\nThe women have said they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and were tricked by men suspected of being North Korean agents.\r\nNorth Korea has a history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime and its chemical weapons arsenal is believed to include the banned VX nerve agent. \r\nPyongyang has denied any role in the killing and hasn't even acknowledged the dead man was Kim Jong Nam.\r\nKim, who was 45 or 46, was the eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding, yet he reportedly fell out of favour in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \r\nHe had been living abroad for years and at the time of his death was traveling on a North Korean diplomatic passport under the name \"Kim Chol,\" the name being used in court.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7300766f0b470d8e74d7349bacd9bc88 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
