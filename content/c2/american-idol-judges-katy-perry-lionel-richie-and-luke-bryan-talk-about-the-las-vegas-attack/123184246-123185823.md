Bryan, Katy Perry and Lionel Richie have signed on as judges for the show's reboot on ABC.\r\n\"We can't let hate and terrorism and all of these things hold us back from the American experience, the music...We can't let it affect us walking down the street,\" said Bryan, adding  \"We have to come to a point where we can trust our leaders and our governments to do everything necessary.\"\r\nLionel Richie agreed that the government needs to address the problem.\r\n\"We cannot sweep it under the rug,\" said Richie. \"This is not gonna just go away.
