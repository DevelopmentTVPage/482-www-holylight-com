    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) CHRIS CYR (SEER) ALWAYS DREADED SHOPPING FOR CLOTHES...\r\nSOUNDBITE (English) Chris Cyr, Standup Comic:\r\n\"If you were lucky you could go to like Kohl's or Target and find the one pair of jeans in your size and a couple of just basic black t-shirts.\"\r\nBUT THEN THE STAND-UP COMIC FROM ST LOUIS DISCOVERED A HOST OF TRENDIER FASHIONS ONLINE. \r\nSOUNDBITE (English) Chris Cyr, Standup Comic:\r\n\"People realized fat people wanted to spend money on clothes.\"\r\nPLUS-SIZE MEN HAS BEEN A LONG-IGNORED GROUP IN THE RETAIL INDUSTRY... BUT ANALYSTS SAY THAT'S STARTING TO CHANGE. \r\nSOUNDBITE Diana Smith, retail and apparel analyst at Mintel: \r\n\"This is a market that is still, for the most part, pretty vastly under-served so I think depending on how you look at that, you could see it as an opportunity for marketers and retailers.\"\r\nONE OF THOSE RETAILERS, THE WINSTON BOX,  IS AN ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE THAT SENDS CUSTOMERS UP TO FOUR ITEMS OF CLOTHING ONCE A  MONTH. THE CALIFORNIA-BASED SERVICE COSTS 75 DOLLARS PER BOX.\r\nMANY OF THESE NICHE COMPANIES ARE MAKING LARGER SIZES OF SLIM-CUT JEANS, BOMBER JACKETS AND OTHER CLOTHES THAT SHOPPERS SAY ARE HARD TO FIND IN STORES.\r\nSOUNDBITE Daniel Franzese, The Winston Box\r\n\"I mean we could walk through an entire mall with pockets full of cash and leave with absolutely nothing.\"\r\nDANIEL FRANZESE (fren-zay-cee), AN ACTOR WHO STARRED IN MEAN GIRLS \u2013IS A CO-OWNER OF THE WINSTON BOX.\r\nHE SAYS HE WAS FRUSTRATED WITH THE LACK OF STYLISH PLUS-SIZE OPTIONS. \r\nSOUNDBITE Daniel Franzese, The Winston Box\r\n\"I don't think the message is big is beautiful. I think the message is you are beautiful at the state that you're in today. Life can be fleeting, life can be short, so why not enjoy your body the way it is right now?\"\r\nRETAIL AND APPAREL ANALYST DIANA SMITH ATTRIBUTES THIS EMERGING MARKET TO THE GROWING PERCENTAGE OF OVERWEIGHT MEN IN THE UNITED STATES, AS WELL AS CHANGING ATTITUDES TOWARD FASHION. \r\nSOUNDBITE Diana Smith, retail and apparel analyst at Mintel: \r\n\"Millennial men around the ages of 18 to 34 are much more likely to consider themselves to be stylish and fashionable. Almost half of men 18-34 actually enjoy shopping for clothes.\"\r\nSHE SAYS THE SUCCESS OF WOMEN'S PLUS-SIZE CLOTHING, WHICH HAD SALES OF MORE THAN 20 BILLION DOLLARS IN 2016, ALSO HELPS. \r\nBUT IT'S NOT JUST MILLENNIALS... CYR NOW HAS A CLOSET FULL OF NEW CLOTHES.... \r\nSOUNDBITE Chris Cyr, Standup comic:\r\n\"You can say what you want but at least I know what I'm wearing looks good and I look good in it so you're not going to hurt my feelings.\"\r\nTHE FASHION INDUSTRY GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT CATERING TO A DIVERSE CLIENTELE.\r\nKRYSTA FAURIA, ASSOCIATED PRESS, GARDENA, CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/40a81f8a57991e9a4fad5039347608f8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
