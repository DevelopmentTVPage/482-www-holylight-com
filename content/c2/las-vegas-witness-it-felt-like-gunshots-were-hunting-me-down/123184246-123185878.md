    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) A survivor of the Las Vegas shooting has told The Associated Press that it felt like the gunman was \"hunting\" people down.\r\nSpeaking during a visit to the city's University Medical Center, Murrell Sailers said his boss and his friend both got hit by bullets as they tried to flee the area.\r\nSailers' wife Nicole said people were just dropping around her, adding that it was \"like being in a warzone\".\r\nBy Monday afternoon, 59 victims were dead and 527 injured in the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history.\r\nThe gunman, identified as Stephen Craig Paddock, a 64-year-old retired accountant from Mesquite, Nevada, killed himself before officers stormed Room 135 on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay casino hotel.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/e1efd430873552a73f27c6d651989394 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
