The idea of women's empowerment was reflected in the flashy colors like those used by Niki de Saint Phalle in her famous gigantic sculptures of women, entitled \"Nanas\" - \"girls\". The models flashed beautiful laced and leather dresses with big red hearts on the front. There were polka dots, black and white checks; striped denim and plenty of 1960s-inspired looks.\r\nDior Artistic Director of the womenswear, Maria Grazia Chiuri, intended to pay tribute to all great women artists and to inspire others. \r\nAs Naomi Watts said after the show, \"I feel like it's a very good time for women expressing themselves and there was a lot of wonderful expressions in these wonderful outfits.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/06abfb02e32feaecbe0013d5965f6704 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
