    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Many Puerto Ricans are still struggling in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria, with their misery compounded by an ongoing power outage in most areas.\r\nOfficials say 93 percent of the island still lacks electricity. \r\nIn the capital, San Juan, where most parts remain without power, Maria Quinones says \"it will be a long wait\" for the electricity to come back to her neighbourhood where she and her family members light kerosene lamps, candles and battery-powered lamps to navigate through their home at night.  \r\nWater service has been restored to about half of customers across the island, according to the governor, who has said he hopes 25 percent of electricity customers will have power by the end of October. \r\nOfficials have said power would be restored to the entire island before March. \r\nMany stores have opened, including half of the island's grocery stores, but many have run out of basic supplies and lines are still long.\r\nSome San Juan residents on Wednesday voiced their disapproval of how US President Donald Trump has handled the crisis on the island.  \r\nTheir unhappiness was reflected in a poll that found that Americans were more likely to disapprove than approve of Trump's handling of the Puerto Rico hurricane relief effort.\r\nAccording to a poll by the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, just 32 percent approve of how Trump is handling disaster relief in the US territory, while 49 percent disapprove.\r\n\"He should have had a little more respect for our people, a little more consideration, a little more humanity,\" said Lucia Navarette, a resident of capital, San Juan.\r\nTrump drew better marks for his handling of the recoveries after hurricanes Harvey and Irma. \r\nForty-eight percent of Americans approve and just 27 percent disapprove of Trump's handling of recoveries in U.S. states, including Texas and Florida.\r\nThe poll was conducted before Trump on Tuesday made his first trip to Puerto Rico, an island 1,000 miles (1609 kilometres) from the mainland, after Hurricane Maria roared ashore September 20 and knocked out all power. \r\nThe federal response has drawn criticism and the administration has aggressively pushed back.\r\nAfter lavishing attention and time on Texas and Florida, Trump tweeted his wish for Puerto Ricans to \"be careful\" just before the storm hit, but then didn't talk publicly about the island's post-hurricane struggles for days as he chose instead to fight with the NFL over some of its players kneeling for the national anthem. \r\nCritics said the president had failed to grasp the magnitude of Maria's destruction as quickly as he had the twin wallops of Harvey and Irma.\r\nA week later, Trump publicly tuned in to Maria's aftermath. \r\nHe sent multiple administration officials out to defend his response. \r\nHe called briefings and meetings and insisted that helping Puerto Ricans was a top priority.\r\nBut Trump also suggested their suffering was partly the fault of officials who had allowed the island's infrastructure and economy to degrade before the hurricanes and said local people should be doing more to help the recovery.\r\nWidespread disasters offer presidents much to gain \u2014 or lose \u2014 politically as they try to play the role of comforter while competently leading the government's response to life-and-death issues for masses of Americans.\r\nThe poll includes responses from people in all states, but not in Puerto Rico or other U.S. territories.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cd9ab1aaa7169691c45bcbe21f19bd79 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
