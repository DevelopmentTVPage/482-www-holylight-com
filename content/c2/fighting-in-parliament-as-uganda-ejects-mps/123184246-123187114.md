    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) A government-backed lawmaker introduced a measure Wednesday to extend the long-time president's rule, following a fight in which opposition lawmakers were forcibly evicted from the legislative chamber.\r\nThe evictions came after the parliamentary speaker, a member of the ruling party, accused some lawmakers of obstructing proceedings in a riotous session Tuesday. \r\nDuring the session legislators brawled over efforts to introduce legislation to remove the presidential age limit of 75 from Uganda's constitution.\r\nFootage from the legislative chamber showed some opposition members of parliament being physically manhandled and dragged out by plainclothes security officials. \r\nThe leader of the opposition, after complaining that special forces had been used to evict her colleagues, later led her team in walking out.\r\nPresident Yoweri Museveni, who is 73 and has ruled Uganda since taking power by force in 1986, is ineligible to run again in 2021 if the age barrier stays.\r\nThe draft legislation must be published in the government gazette before it is debated in the National Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ed1468efd4270f8f95c9412dafec9bcc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
