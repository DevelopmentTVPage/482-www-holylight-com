    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) WOMAN SEEKS REVIVAL OF DEFAMATION SUIT AGAINST BILL COSBY\r\nAn attorney for a woman who says Bill Cosby raped her more than four decades ago has urged a federal appeals court to revive her defamation lawsuit against the comedian.\r\nF. William Salo told a three-judge panel of the 1st U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday (04OCT2017) that Cosby destroyed Katherine McKee's reputation when his lawyer wrote a letter demanding a retraction of a 2014 New York Daily News story about her rape allegations.\r\nCosby's attorney told the judges that a federal court in Massachusetts was right to dismiss her lawsuit. Alan Greenberg said McKee would have to prove Cosby acted with actual malice because she became a kind of public figure when she gave the interview.\r\nThe judges are expected to rule in the coming weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/18c1d595dc351eb36bac20cc72ef47d2 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
