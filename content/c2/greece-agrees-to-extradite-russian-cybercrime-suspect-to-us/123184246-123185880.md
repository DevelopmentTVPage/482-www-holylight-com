    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) A Greek court ruled on Wednesday to extradite Russian cybercrime suspect Alexander Vinnik to the United States, where he is wanted in a 4 billion US dollar bitcoin fraud case.\r\nThe three-member panel of judges backed the US extradition request for the 37-year-old, who was arrested while on vacation in northern Greece on 25 July.\r\nVinnik has the right to appeal to the Supreme Court, and was expected to do so later on Wednesday.\r\nRussia is also seeking Vinnik's extradition on separate fraud charges, but no date has yet been set for that hearing.\r\nWhile fighting his extradition to the US, Vinnik's lawyers said he would not contest the Russian request.\r\nUS authorities accuse Vinnik of running digital currency exchange BTC-e and of involvement in laundering money from criminal proceeds, charges he denies.\r\nSpeaking during Wednesday's hearing, Vinnik repeated that he had nothing to do with the digital platform he is accused of running to commit the bitcoin fraud.\r\nHe said he was merely a technician and the platform was one of his clients.\r\nVinnik said electronic equipment confiscated during his arrest was not related to his job, and that the laptop seized by police contained only cartoons for his children.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a4e6d221e66f1beeb3ce71856e17ba4b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
