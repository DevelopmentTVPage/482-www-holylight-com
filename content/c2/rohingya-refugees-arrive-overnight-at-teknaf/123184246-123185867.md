    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) The influx of Rohingya refugees fleeing violence in Myanmar continued on Tuesday night with hundreds more arriving by boats overnight including women and young children.\r\nAmong them was eight months pregnant Anowara Begum from Mongdu, exhausted after making the perilous journey .\r\nSeventy-year old Hamida Khatun, who fled with her three daughters and grandchildren, said their houses had been \"destroyed by fire and there was nothing left behind\".\r\nThe boatmen who had brought the fleeing Rohingya refugees into Bangladesh were tied together and detained by the Bangladesh Border Guards for questioning.\r\nMore than half-a-million Rohingya refugees have fled from the region to Bangladesh in just over a month, the largest refugee crisis to hit Asia in decades.\r\nThe current exodus is in addition to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled prior violence in Myanmar, where Rohingya have faced decades of persecution and discrimination in the Buddhist-majority nation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/254bd03d31817b5e7eeac8bf262269f3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
