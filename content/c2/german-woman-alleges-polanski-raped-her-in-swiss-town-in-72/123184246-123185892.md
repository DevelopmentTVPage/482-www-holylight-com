    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) GERMAN WOMAN ALLEGES POLANSKI RAPED HER IN SWISS TOWN IN '72\r\nSwiss authorities say they have received a complaint from a German woman alleging that famed filmmaker Roman Polanski raped her 45 years ago in Gstaad, Switzerland, while she was in her mid-teens.\r\nPolice and the state prosecutor's office in the northern city of St. Gallen say Renate Langer, 61, issued the complaint over the alleged rape in February 1972 in a city police station on Sept. 26.\r\nPolice spokesman Florian Schneider said it was unclear why Langer filed the complaint in the city as Gstaad is inside the judicial jurisdiction of the Bern region.\r\nThe St. Gallen prosecutor's office said the case will be transferred Wednesday to the \"appropriate authorities\" in Bern.\r\nThe Polish-born filmmaker fled the U.S. in 1978 after forcing himself on a teenage girl a year earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/275dd6fe9b88e1c100e8cd8292521734 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
