    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) THOM BROWNE PRESENTS WOMENSWEAR IN PARIS FOR THE FIRST TIME\r\nAmerican designer Thom Browne, best known for menswear, presented his womenswear in Paris for the first time on Tuesday (03OCT2017)afternoon. \r\nThe fantastical show featured fairies, anchors, a skeleton, an octopus, even a unicorn...along with meters and meters of tulle. A true spectacle with a host of unworldly characters, the show took place in the painted and gilded decor of the Paris City Hall.\r\n\"It was a very childlike dream of French couture,\" said Browne. And though the theme was light and childlike, the craftsmanship was serious.\r\nThe collection was closer to couture than ready-to-wear, with models in sculptural works of art (and some more easily wearable pieces scattered here and there). Brown used tulle to reinterpret a range of fabrics, from madras tweed to plaid to seersucker. He embroidered tulle with tennis rackets (a nod to American preppy tradition) and anchors. As always, he played with shapes and proportions, hanging an oversized, furry houndstooth tulle jacket onto suspenders, dangling trousers from corsets, presenting sack capes and coats. \r\nTo end the show, two male puppeteers walked out wearing a white tulle \"unicorn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8f33ccb14d2af5acdfbf8103f08ee54b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
