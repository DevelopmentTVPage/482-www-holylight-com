    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) U.S. President Donald Trump along with his wife Melania left the White House Tuesday for a trip to Las Vegas to meet with the first responders and victims of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. History. \r\n\"Well it's a very sad thing,\" said Trump.\r\n\"We're going to pay our respects and to see the police who've done really a fantastic job in a very short time and they're learning a lot more and that'll be announced at the appropriate time. It's a very, very sad day for me.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/98c43be9440bf2fda8402fd944432dbe \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
