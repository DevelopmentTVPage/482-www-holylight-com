She confirmed reports of her departure on Twitter on Wednesday (4 OCT. 2017), writing that \"there have been all kinds of false rumors as to why\" she's leaving.\r\nShe says neither CBS nor the show's producers are \"mad\" at her and the decision to leave was one she made last year. The 48-year-old Perrette adds that she loves her character \"as much as you do.\"\r\n\"We've known for some time this would be Pauley's final season on 'NCIS' and have been working toward a special send-off,\" the show's executive producers said in a statement. \"Abby is a character that inspires \r\nmillions of fans around the world, and all of us at 'NCIS' are appreciative of Pauley for portraying her.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/ee7e99538951e4bb158abbb68c675401 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
