    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan arrived in Tehran on Wednesday where he was formally welcomed by his Iranian counterpart, Hassan Rouhani.\r\nWith Turkey's president by his side, Rouhani pledged that they would ensure borders in the region remain unchanged after the recent Kurdish independence referendum in Iraq.\r\nBoth Iran and Turkey opposed the referendum, which overwhelmingly passed last week, and have sent troops to their borders with the Iraqi Kurdish region. \r\nIraq's central government also staunchly opposed the vote.\r\nThe non-binding referendum, in which the Kurds voted more than 90 percent in favour of a break with Iraq, will not immediately result in independence. \r\nBut Kurdish leaders have said they will use it to press for negotiations on eventually forming their own state.\r\nThat has set off alarm bells in Baghdad, where the government has said it is determined to prevent a break-up of the country, and in Iraq's neighbours, Iran and Turkey, which fear the vote will fuel similar ambitions among their own Kurdish populations.\r\nA flight ban halted all international flights from servicing the Iraqi Kurdish territory's airports on Friday.\r\nErdogan will meet Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei later on Wednesday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bb4aea2032244ca28ca74727e4883bf5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
