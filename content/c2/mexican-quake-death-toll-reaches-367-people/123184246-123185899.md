    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) While officials have raised the death toll of the 7.1-magnitude earthquake in Mexico to 367 people, Mexicans in the capital have begun to ask why some of the buildings collapsed.\r\n\"Call them to testify,\" said an angry Luis Manuel Ortiz, protesting on Tuesday at the Juarez Monument. \"There is responsibility, acts of corruption, and also acts of negligence, and this city is ruled by laws.\"\r\nThe last remaining bodies were being recovered from a collapsed office building in Mexico City.\r\nThe undersecretary for Human Rights of the Interior Ministry, Roberto Campa Cifrian, said on Tuesday based on accounts provided by relatives of the people trapped under the rubble that only one person remains to be found and recovered from the site.\r\nThe toll in the capital stood at 226 on Tuesday. There were also 74 in Morelos, 45 in Puebla, 15 in Mexico State, six in Guerrero and one in Oaxaca.\r\nThe September 19 earthquake followed an even stronger 8.1-magnitude earthquake that struck the southern states of Oaxaca and Chiapas killing nearly 100 people.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/91a450c0fec1e2ca2246887f4ff8e0f9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
