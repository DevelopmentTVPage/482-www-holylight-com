    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Temporary refugee shelters are being erected across Bangladesh' Cox's Bazar district as the influx of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar continues.\r\nMakeshift camps are fanning out over farms and open land in the area. \r\nMore than 500,000 Rohingya Muslims have crossed the border into Bangladesh since 25 August to escape violent attacks in Rakhine state. \r\nWhile the United Nations and other aid agencies are providing thousands of shelters, the demand far outstrips the supply.\r\nRecently arrived refugees are clearing hilly areas for small patches of land and setting up bamboo frames covered in plastic sheets to provide shelter for their families.\r\nMany face acute shortage of drinking water, food and and accessible lavatories.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/cf1c71f4f06b09a71ac83e71a91b9195 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
