    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) LEADIN\r\nA jobs fair has taken place at Jordan's Zaatari refugee camp to connect the displaced people there with employers.\r\nMore than 50 Jordanian and international companies attended.\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe Head of the European Union delegation in Jordan, Andrea Matteo Fontana, and United Nations officials arrive at the first ever jobs fair to take place at the Zaatari camp in Jordan.\r\nIt's part of an EU-sponsored effort to help refugees become more self-reliant during what could be years more of exile. \r\nFontana says the objective is simple: to match refugees with companies looking to employ them:\r\n\"Today we have here more than 50 companies looking for 1350 employees and we have hundreds of Syrian refugees looking for some jobs and we hope that through this fair we are going to facilitate this matching.\"\r\nMore than 50 Jordanian and international companies are advertising hundreds of jobs in areas including textiles, construction and agriculture.\r\nFontana adds that any product made with at least 15 percent Syrian labour will be given easier access to the European market and that this will hopefully result \"in more jobs for Syrian refugees, for Jordanians and a bigger Jordanian economy that will benefit everyone.\"\r\nZaatari camp is Jordan's largest for Syrian refugees. \r\nSome five million Syrians have fled their homeland since the conflict erupted in 2011, including 660,000 registered in Jordan.\r\nLosing jobs was inevitable, but this fair is being seen as the first step to getting many of them back into employment.\r\n\"You are starting the recruitment process here but it is only the first step of the recruitment process. There will be second interviews, there will be tests, and only after that the jobs will be secured for the refugees. So it is only the first point of contact between the refugees and these companies,\" says Patrick Daru, Country Co-ordinator for International Labour Organisation. \r\nShadi Ahmad, a Syrian refugee from Deraa, has skills in the energy sector and is optimistic about his prospects at the fair.\r\n\"Fortunately there is more than one company looking for skilled people like me and I've applied for all of them,\" he says.\r\nNe'ma Janadi is also from Deraa.\r\nShe's hopeful she will be able to secure work near to her family.\r\n\"All the people have families and I have five children and it is better for them and for me to work close to them. I had a tailoring job in Syria but I lost it when I came here. And now I'd like to work in the sewing profession, and we hope to have this job opportunity inside the camp.\"\r\nEmployers at the fair were just as positive about the benefit the fair will have for their companies.\r\nSuleiman al-Shoriaki is the manager of a garments factory and is looking to employ 60 male and female workers across different departments on a salary of 225 Jordan dinars (317.7 US dollars) with numerous benefits.\r\n\"(We're) also (offering) health insurance, social security, transportation from the company to the camp and we can provide them accommodation in Al-Dlail (town in Mafraq city).\"\r\n\"We are ready to provide them with the accommodation and we hope to shoulder some of the burden from the Jordanian government and help the Syrian refugees,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b1e9b2428a6fcabf386f0ff2b812fbbf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
