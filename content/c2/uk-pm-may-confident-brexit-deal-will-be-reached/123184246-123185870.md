    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) British Prime Minister Theresa May said she is confident that a Brexit deal will be reached that will work for Britain and Europe.\r\nMay says \"it is profoundly in our interests for the negotiations to succeed\" and result in a new relationship between the UK and the European Union.\r\nBut she says \"it is our responsibility as a government to prepare for every eventuality. And let me reassure everyone in this hall - that is exactly what we are doing.\"\r\nBoth Britain and the EU have expressed impatience with the slow progress of Brexit talks, which are bogged down in details of the divorce agreement.\r\nMay also said that EU nationals that have made a life for themselves in the UK are valued and she urged Brexit negotiating teams to reach an agreement on their future quickly.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/53133afa6903a2fd29e47142311e4098 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
