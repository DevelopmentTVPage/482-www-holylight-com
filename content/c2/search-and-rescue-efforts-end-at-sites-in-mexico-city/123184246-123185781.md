    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Search and rescue efforts finally came to an end Wednesday in Mexico City, a full four weeks and one day after a magnitude 7.1 earthquake rocked the city.\r\nJumpsuit-clad rescuers still clambered over what remained of a seven-floor office building, which counted an employment agency and accounting firm among its tenants.\r\nThe last body known to be trapped in rubble was recovered two weeks after the earthquake.\r\nA massive crane sat idle under grey skies and drizzle as workers began breaking down large tents that had housed the waiting relatives of those trapped in the rubble. \r\nMexico City Mayor Miguel Angel Mancera said at a news conference that the office building was the last place in the city where bodies were being recovered.\r\nThe national Civil Defense chief, Luis Felipe Puente, tweeted that the official federal death toll had risen to 369. Of those, 228 were in the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/72de40cc1618a4b8af12da2e6db50c3c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
