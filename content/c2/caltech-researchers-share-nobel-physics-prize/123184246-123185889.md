    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) The two California scientists sharing this year's Nobel Physics Prize credited each other and their third partner, as well as the team that helped build and maintain the instrument that helped them discover gravitational waves.\r\nKip Thorne and Barry Barish of the California Institute of Technology spoke Tuesday at the school about 12 miles northeast of Los Angeles, just hours after learning they had won.\r\nThe pair, along with Rainer Weiss of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, were honored for their observation of gravitational waves, which Einstein first predicted a century ago.\r\nBarish said the laser device, called an interferometer, is \"one of the best and most amazing instruments ever built by mankind.\" He gave credit to administrators, scientists, students and government officials he said were behind its creation.\r\nThorne said the instrument would create new science for centuries to come.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/059a7ca29da577b24f7e54d9b2349fe8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
