    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Israeli police and medical services say an attacker has opened fire at the entrance to a town outside Jerusalem, killing three Israelis.\r\nPolice spokesman Micky Rosenfeld says the attack took place early on Tuesday just outside the community of Had Adar.\r\nThere was no word yet on the identity of the attacker but Rosenfeld says it's being treated as a terrorist attack. \r\nThe Magen David Adom medical service says a fourth Israeli is in critical condition.\r\nSince 2015, Palestinians have killed 48 Israelis, two visiting Americans and a British tourist in stabbings, shooting and car-ramming attacks. \r\nIn that time, Israeli forces have killed over 255 Palestinians, most said by Israel to be attackers.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/bc8c5ac241a9ec811d928265f3431ab7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
