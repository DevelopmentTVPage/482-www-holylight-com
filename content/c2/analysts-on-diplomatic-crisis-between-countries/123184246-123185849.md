    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nJordan has called on Israel to launch a proper legal inquiry into a fatal shooting in which an Israeli security guard killed two Jordanian civilians.\r\nIsrael called the shooting self defence but the incident has created a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.\r\n\r\nSTRORYLINE:\r\nOn most days, Zakariya al-Jawawdeh visits the grave of his 16-year-old son Mohammed, watering plants and reciting a prayer. Each trip to the cemetery, a few steps from his home in Jordan's capital, Amman, also stokes frustration that his son's killer, an Israeli security guard, has not yet been held accountable.\r\nThe furniture store owner's grievances are entangled in one of the most toxic diplomatic crises since Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994.\r\nAccording to a Jordanian official the relationship - typically low-key, but strategically important - has been \"hit hard\" on all levels by the shooting on 23 July 2017 at Israel's embassy in Jordan. The Israeli guard behind the attack also killed his middle-aged Jordanian landlord. \r\nZakariya al-Jawawdeh is demanding justice for his son:\r\n\"This is a sovereign country and has its ruling system and has its law, so the law must be implemented, not only for my sake, this is for the sake of all Jordanians, and for all Jordanians not to feel weak and not to say that Jordanians are losing their rights in their own country,\" he says.\r\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry, which says the guard acted in self defence after the teen attacked him with a screw driver, declined comment on potential damage to the relationship. \r\nSpokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said Israel will share the eventual results of an ongoing investigation with Jordan, but would not describe the type of inquiry under way.\r\nCore elements of the relationship have survived.\r\nSecurity cooperation continues against shared enemies, such as Islamic extremist groups, but at a reduced level, said the Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid a further escalation of tensions. But other endeavours, such as a the third phase of a programme to employ Jordanians in Israeli hotels and conference on water and energy cooperation have suffered.\r\nHamada Faraaneh, a political analyst and former MP says Jordan, is unlikely to back down until the Israeli security guard is put on legal and public trial and his victims' families are compensated:\r\n\"I don't think Jordan will show any signs of retreat or slack, because this case has transformed into a public case and it can not be tolerated in this regard, especially the continuous Israeli policy in settlements, failure to comply with the terms of settlement. I think this is the prime and substantial reason that these factors create more tension,\" he says. \r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been assigned much of the blame for the diplomatic crisis due to his handling of the shooting aftermath.\r\nThe shooting came at a time of tensions over a Muslim-administered Jerusalem holy site that is revered by Muslims and Jews. \r\nThe day after the shooting, after a phone call between Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah II, Jordan allowed the guard to leave under the cover of diplomatic immunity, while Israel removed metal detectors at the holy site in an apparent tradeoff.\r\nBut two days after the fatal shooting, Netanyahu praised the guard in a hero's welcome at the prime minister's office. Netanyahu told the guard he had acted \"calmly\" and he was \"happy that things ended the way they did\".\r\nJordan's monarch promptly slammed Netanyahu for \"provocative\" behaviour, accusing him of trying to score political points in Israel, where the prime minister was being criticised for his handling of the metal detector controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/736fd4268ea1be20a5562aed3484cf94 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
