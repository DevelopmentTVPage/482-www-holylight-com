    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Las Vegas shooting survivor Natalie Vanderstay clutches a pillow to her stomach, right over the spot where a bullet hit her on Sunday night. Blankets cover the leg that was ripped apart, probably by shrapnel. \r\nThe 43-year-old Los Angeles nurse can hardly believe she's alive. She saw plenty of dead and dying people on her flight from the massacre on the Las Vegas Strip. She even had to walk on some of them to get to a fence that she somehow was able to jump before hunkering down with a group of strangers, waiting for the seemingly endless gunfire to stop. \r\nVanderstay is hospitalized in the University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/1b454b1a2295d3eeb185b8fe2f72c7cb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
