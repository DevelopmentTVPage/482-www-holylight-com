    "description": "(26 Sep 2017) Seattle Seahawks coach Pete Carroll says there were difficult conversations in the process of his team deciding to stay in the locker room during the national anthem Sunday.\r\nThat included supporters of President Donald Trump, who put aside their personal beliefs to show unity as a team, Carroll says.\r\nThe coach says, \"They had a choice to do what they wanted to do and they decided to stay with the team, and that was a hard decision for a few guys and I totally understand that.\"\r\nSeattle's players have been among the most outspoken in the NFL on social issues. Carroll says he's not sure what if any form of protest the Seahawks will take when they return home Sunday to play the Indianapolis Colts.\r\nSpeaking to reporters Monday, Carroll said he was hopeful the discussion about player and team actions, coming off the remarks made by Trump, would focus attention on player concerns. \r\n\"I think it's extraordinary that this is happening,\" Carroll said.  \"I hope we learn about empathy, to listen, and to come to an understanding of what somebody else feels without passing judgement,\" he added. \r\nTrump has created drama over the last three days by criticizing activist athletes. He's drawn criticism for saying football players who kneel during the national anthem should be fired.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c5dcb68217e34c4cc028ec0098945952 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
