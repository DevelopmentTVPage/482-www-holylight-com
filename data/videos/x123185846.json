    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) COUNTRY STAR RANDY HOUSER 'IN A PILE OF TEARS,' OVER VEGAS ATTACK; ROUTE 91 ACT WALKER MCGUIRE VOW TO PLAY ON\r\nCountry duo Walker McGuire have spoken of their shock as they learned of the deadly shooting in Las Vegas, Sunday - two days after they had played the Route 91 Harvest Festival themselves.\r\n59 people were killed and at least 527 people injured when a gunman shot at tens of thousands of concertgoers, who were watching Jason Aldean play the festival's closing set.\r\n\"Yeah it was, it was a terrible tragedy, you know,\" said Jordan Walker, Tuesday (3 OCT. 2017)\r\n\"The first thing we did was text everyone we knew and luckily everyone we knew was safe,\" added his bandmate Johnny McGuire.\r\nThe pair are in London to play Country Music Week, which kicked off in London, Monday, with a show headlined by Randy Houser.\r\n\"Yeah it was really, really tough last night and yesterday,\" \"Fired Up\" singer Houser said.\r\n\"I woke up to it here in London, and hearing all the news, had several friends who were on site for the terror attack and many of them just basically narrowly escaped with their lives. Everybody that I know is accounted for and we were very lucky for that.\"\r\n\"We had a show last night here, it was actually my first show in the U.K., which is very exciting but it felt, all day it felt like the wind had been taken out of my sails, you know,\" Houser continued, adding he felt that playing the gig as planned was the right thing to do.\r\n\"Even the fans that lost their lives yesterday, I felt like it was the right thing to do to push on for the fans here, that's what they would want, they would never want us to stop or slow down what we're doing for that and I felt like that was the wrong attitude. So we pushed through and I'll be honest, it did affect me and last night it really affected me when I got home, when I got back to my hotel here, and started seeing photos of the people who had passed on and hear their back stories and all, I was sort of laid there in a pile of tears, you know. It just really hurt.\"\r\nBoth acts spoke of their pride over the country fans that pulled together during the attack.\r\nCouples held hands as they ran. The healthy carried the bleeding off the grounds.
