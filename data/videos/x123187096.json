    "description": "(27 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nAn exhibition showcasing the four finalists of the \"Prize of the National Gallery\" has opened in Berlin.\r\nThe prize is one of Germany's most prestigious art accolades. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nWelcome to the Amazonas Shopping Centre.\r\nYou won't be able to buy anything here, it's an art installation by Berlin-based Venezuelan artist Sol Caleron.\r\nThe work doesn't recreate shopping centres found in Caleron's native Caracas, instead, the 35-year old artist is exploring the spaces that immigrants create for themselves in Europe.\r\nThe colourful shopping centre has a hair salon, a currency exchange booth, an internet cafe and even a small cinema.\r\nIt's based on a real shopping complex, also called the Amazonas Shopping Centre, that Caleron visited in London.\r\nCaleron has been living in Europe since she was 17. She says she has struggled to balance her identity with the need to integrate into a new society. \r\nThis is something that is reflected in her work.\r\n\"No matter how much you do to integrate, it is always never enough. And while you are doing that, trying to integrate into a new society, you are also losing a lot of your own identity. So it became a point where I was like, not only wanted to understand more of the place where I was coming from, but I also wanted to understand what was my identity as an artist,\" she says.\r\nCaleron is one of four artists shortlisted for the \"Prize of the National Gallery\" - one of Germany's most prestigious art prizes.\r\nThe prize is open to artists that are under 40-years-old and live and work in Germany.\r\nThis year, for the first time, the four shortlisted artists are all women.\r\nAnd none of them are German, reflecting the international art scene of Berlin.\r\nJumana Manna, a Palestinian artist who was born in the US, is showing an installation consisting of a film and oversized objects.\r\nThe film, called \"A Magical Substance Flows Into Me\" traces the dislocation of communities, from the 1930s onwards, in what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.\r\nThe film recreates a radio programme of the time focussing on the music of different communities.\r\nThe artefacts in the installation complement the video, says the 30-year-old Manna.\r\n\"I like to create an environment that considers the space and also the audience's bodies within the space.  So in this exhibition, there is a series called the muscle-based series. It is different forms, kind of androgynous forms of muscles or body fragments that are oversized. Biceps or elbows or fingers. And they are made of plaster and they are hollow. And they connect to the film in the theme of muscle memory. So the film is very much about telling history through the senses and through the muscle memory that is needed to perform music and memorise music over generations.\"\r\nIman Issa is a Berlin-based, Egyptian artist.\r\nIn her exhibition, artefacts that she has seen in antiquities museums have been carefully recreated using modern materials and techniques.\r\nThe objects look new, but at the same time, the viewer gets the sense that they belong to another time. Or maybe it is that the original objects belong to our time, says Issa.\r\n\"The project came from, maybe started around 2011 or 2012 in terms of thinking. And it was based on a feeling of going around antiquities museums and having a sense that the objects there spoke in a way that I don't remember from before. And that they had a very strange presence that didn't seem to belong to the past, but seemed quite relevant to the present.\"\r\nAgnieszka Polska is a Polish artist based in Berlin.\r\nHer video installation deals with what she calls the \"disaster\" happening to the world.\r\nThe 32-year old artist says all her work is about social responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6cd0e5769294b793b20fc3aa44e8969f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
