    "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker both said Cuban intelligence agencies have the ability to figure out who is behind the unexplained attacks on American diplomats in Havana, given Cuban society is heavily monitored. \r\n\"The idea that in a place like that, Americans could be severely injured and the Cuban government not know who did it is absurd,\" Sen. Rubio said. \r\nThe Senators, along with other members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, were briefed by officials from the State Department in a closed hearing on Wednesday. \r\nThe United States expelled 15 of Cuba's diplomats on Tuesday to protest its failure to protect Americans from the unexplained attacks, plunging diplomatic ties between the countries to levels unseen in years.\r\nOnly days ago, the U.S. and Cuba maintained dozens of diplomats in newly re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington, powerful symbols of a warming relationship between longtime foes. Now both countries are poised to cut their embassies by more than half, as invisible, unexplained attacks threaten delicate relations between the Cold War rivals.\r\nThe State Department gave Cuba's ambassador a list Tuesday of 15 names and ordered them out within one week, officials said, in a move that aims to \"ensure equity\" between each nation's embassy staffing. Last week, the U.S. announced it was withdrawing 60 percent of its own diplomats from Havana because they might be attacked and harmed if they stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/f008c2c7bcd5aefea5a4cfbc2f7d79f7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
