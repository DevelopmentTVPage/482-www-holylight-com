    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Cuba's Foreign Minister denounced the forcible removal of 15 Cuban diplomats from the US, saying the act is unjustified and politically motivated.\r\nBruno Rodriguez made the comments on Tuesday at a press conference in Havana, where he also rejected the accusation that Cuba is responsible for the mysterious \"sonic attacks,\" which have injured 22 US diplomats and their family members, as well as at least one Canadian diplomat.\r\nRodriguez said in his conversation with US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson last week, the top US diplomat offered \"no evidence\" of Cuban involvement in the strange incidents, nor any progress in the months-long investigation into the matter.\r\nThe Cuban Foreign Minister said expelling the Cuban diplomats from the US in retaliation for the incidents is simply a \"political act.\"\r\nRodriguez said the move will strain ties between the two countries, but pledged diplomatic relations, at least from the Cuban side, will continue.\r\nThe so-called \"sonic attacks\" injured almost two dozen diplomatic personnel in Cuba, leaving them with concussion-like symptoms, but no clear indication of who perpetuated the attacks, or how they did so. \r\nThe Hotel Nacional, on the seaside Malecon was one site of an alleged attack against a US diplomat, along with the Hotel Capri. US diplomats said other attacks occurred in their homes, but so far investigators have turned up no method for how the attacks were made, nor any perpetrators of the assaults.\r\nThe expulsion of the Cuban diplomatic personnel over the unsolved attacks has angered the Cuban Government, which has vehemently denied any involvement in the incidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/96faff10a5b9f46bea43d99cb4e3b355 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
