There will be second interviews, there will be tests, and only after that the jobs will be secured for the refugees. So it is only the first point of contact between the refugees and these companies,\" says Patrick Daru, Country Co-ordinator for International Labour Organisation. \r\nShadi Ahmad, a Syrian refugee from Deraa, has skills in the energy sector and is optimistic about his prospects at the fair.\r\n\"Fortunately there is more than one company looking for skilled people like me and I've applied for all of them,\" he says.\r\nNe'ma Janadi is also from Deraa.\r\nShe's hopeful she will be able to secure work near to her family.\r\n\"All the people have families and I have five children and it is better for them and for me to work close to them. I had a tailoring job in Syria but I lost it when I came here. And now I'd like to work in the sewing profession, and we hope to have this job opportunity inside the camp.\"\r\nEmployers at the fair were just as positive about the benefit the fair will have for their companies.\r\nSuleiman al-Shoriaki is the manager of a garments factory and is looking to employ 60 male and female workers across different departments on a salary of 225 Jordan dinars (317.7 US dollars) with numerous benefits.\r\n\"(We're) also (offering) health insurance, social security, transportation from the company to the camp and we can provide them accommodation in Al-Dlail (town in Mafraq city).\"\r\n\"We are ready to provide them with the accommodation and we hope to shoulder some of the burden from the Jordanian government and help the Syrian refugees,\" he says.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/b1e9b2428a6fcabf386f0ff2b812fbbf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
