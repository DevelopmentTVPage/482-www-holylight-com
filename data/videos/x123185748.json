The American people have heard you. They share your dream and overwhelmingly support your dream,\" said Graham.\r\n\"What you represent are people who can bring real value to America make it a better place, \" Durbin said. \"Lindsey is right in saying that we are poised to do the right thing as a nation and you are going to be the reason,\" he said.\r\nSeveral \"Dreamers\" also spoke at the event.\r\n\"The Dream Act is not controversial.
