    "description": "(3 Oct 2017) US President Donald Trump and his wife Melania toured storm-damaged Puerto Rico on Tuesday. \r\nThe Trumps made the visit to review the US island's recovery from Hurricane Maria, which blew ashore on September 20. \r\nTrump met a family whose neighbourhood and home were damaged by the hurricane and told them \"We're going to help you out. Have a good time.\"\r\nTrump's visit came after what critics have said was a slow response to the crisis on the island. At least 16 people have died from the hurricane.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/c97bd9ead4d5db0a63306a5d05c5ebe6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
