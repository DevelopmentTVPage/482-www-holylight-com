            "description": "(3 Oct 2017) Outcast North Korean scion Kim Jong Nam had extremely low levels of an enzyme vital for nervous system function in his body due to poisoning, a Malaysian government pathologist testified on Tuesday at the trial of two women accused of smearing VX nerve agent on Kim's face in a brazen airport assassination.\r\nBlood tests on the two murder suspects showed they had normal enzyme levels, said chemical pathologist Nur Ashikin Othman on the second day of their trial in Malaysia's High Court.\r\nThe potency of VX depends on the dosage or concentration, the type and duration of exposure and whether decontamination measures such as washing hands or taking an antidote were made, she added.\r\nGooi Soon Seng, the lawyer for Indonesian Siti Aisyah, told reporters the normal enzyme levels supported their assertion that the two women were not exposed to VX.\r\nSiti Aisyah of Indonesia and Doan Thi Huong of Vietnam pleaded not guilty as their trial opened on Monday in the killing of Kim, widely thought to have been orchestrated by his half brother, North Korea's third-generation leader Kim Jong Un. \r\nThe women have said they thought they were playing a harmless prank for a hidden-camera TV show and were tricked by men suspected of being North Korean agents.\r\nNorth Korea has a history of ordering killings of people it views as threats to its regime and its chemical weapons arsenal is believed to include the banned VX nerve agent. \r\nPyongyang has denied any role in the killing and hasn't even acknowledged the dead man was Kim Jong Nam.\r\nKim, who was 45 or 46, was the eldest son of the family that has ruled North Korea since its founding, yet he reportedly fell out of favour in 2001 when he was caught trying to enter Japan on a false passport, saying he wanted to visit Tokyo Disneyland. \r\nHe had been living abroad for years and at the time of his death was traveling on a North Korean diplomatic passport under the name \"Kim Chol,\" the name being used in court.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7300766f0b470d8e74d7349bacd9bc88 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Dianne Feinstein, who has long expressed concern over the availability of such accessories, said Tuesday that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock modified at least one of his weapons with a bump stock device, but she did not elaborate.\r\nA semi-automatic weapon requires one trigger pull for each round fired. With a fully automatic firearm, one trigger pull can unleash continuous rounds until the magazine is empty. The bump-stock devices work by manipulating the trigger mechanism extremely rapidly, far faster than a person could do so without them.\r\nAuthorities found two bump stocks in Paddock's hotel room, two officials familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. \r\nThey are investigating whether those items were used to modify weapons used in the massacre, according to the officials, who were briefed by law enforcement and spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo hasn't said whether they played a role in the rampage.\r\nAuthorities say Paddock opened fire from the windows of his 32nd floor hotel room late Sunday, killing 59 people and wounding hundreds more at a country music festival. Police stormed his room and found he had killed himself after committing the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\r\nWitnesses and law enforcement official said the quick, 50-round bursts of gunfire raised the possibility that Paddock had used a fully automatic weapon or modified his semi-automatic rifles to function like one. Paddock had 23 guns in his hotel room.\r\nYet the purchasing of fully automatic weapons has been significantly restricted in the U.S. since the 1930s.\r\nIn 1986, the federal National Firearms Act was amended further to prohibit the transfer or possession of machine guns by civilians, with an exception for those previously manufactured and registered.\r\nNumerous attempts to design retrofits failed until recent years when bump stocks came on the market.\r\nThe device basically replaces the gun's shoulder rest, with a \"support step\" that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter's finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, \"bumping\" the trigger.\r\nTechnically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/22af52cb692a451d9f6d669b86be215b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(4 Oct 2017) The spokesperson for the pro-unionist Catalan Socialist Party (PSC) said on Wednesday that the regional parliament's socialist group is preparing an appeal against the actions of the pro-separatist government to present to the Spanish Constitutional Court.\r\nCatalonia's regional government said on Wednesday it is preparing to declare the region's independence from Spain following Sunday's contested referendum, with some lawmakers saying it would happen as soon as Monday, 9 October. \r\nAs Spain grappled with its most serious national crisis in decades, a top EU official said Spain and Catalonia must talk with each other, even if Catalonia broke the law with an illegal referendum on independence.\r\nCatalonia's regional president, Carles Puigdemont, who has said an independence declaration will come in a few days, is delivering a televised speech later on Wednesday. \r\nSpain, which has declared Sunday's referendum illegal and invalid, is bitterly opposed to any independence move.\r\nPrime Minister Mariano Rajoy's conservative government has said it will respond with \"all necessary measures\" to counter Catalan defiance, and is holding talks with opposition leaders in Madrid to forge a consensus over what to do.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/922d15d4f80f1bee7e44cb92d59f2508 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
