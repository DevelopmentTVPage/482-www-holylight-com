A true spectacle with a host of unworldly characters, the show took place in the painted and gilded decor of the Paris City Hall.\r\n\"It was a very childlike dream of French couture,\" said Browne. And though the theme was light and childlike, the craftsmanship was serious.\r\nThe collection was closer to couture than ready-to-wear, with models in sculptural works of art (and some more easily wearable pieces scattered here and there). Brown used tulle to reinterpret a range of fabrics, from madras tweed to plaid to seersucker. He embroidered tulle with tennis rackets (a nod to American preppy tradition) and anchors. As always, he played with shapes and proportions, hanging an oversized, furry houndstooth tulle jacket onto suspenders, dangling trousers from corsets, presenting sack capes and coats. \r\nTo end the show, two male puppeteers walked out wearing a white tulle \"unicorn.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/8f33ccb14d2af5acdfbf8103f08ee54b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(3 Oct 2017) The Vatican secretary of state is urging law enforcement agencies, governments and social media sites to take responsibility to protect children from online sexual abuse and exploitation, even as one of his diplomats is caught up in an international child porn investigation.\r\nCardinal Pietro Parolin made the appeal on Tuesday at the opening of a Catholic Church-sponsored conference on protecting children from predators in cyberspace.\r\nFather Hans Zollner, President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Pontifical Gregorian University, opened the conference with a list of abuses inflicted on children using digital media and demanded that \"we stop these terror attacks on the hearts of children.\"\r\nParticipants offered sobering statistics about the problem. \r\nLast year, Interpol identified five child victims of online abuse every day. \r\nAlso last year, the Internet Watch Foundation identified more than 57,000 websites containing child sexual abuse images.\r\nThe conference is addressing both the harm done to children who are abused and the effects on children's development from being exposed to online pornography.\r\nThe conference came just weeks after Parolin recalled a diplomat from the Vatican's embassy in Washington. \r\nCanadian police have issued an arrest warrant accusing Monsignor Carlo Capella of accessing, possessing and distributing child pornography during a visit to an Ontario church over Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/23313fdfc9643f61a08b56536144c5ab \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Las Vegas shooting survivor Natalie Vanderstay clutches a pillow to her stomach, right over the spot where a bullet hit her on Sunday night. Blankets cover the leg that was ripped apart, probably by shrapnel. \r\nThe 43-year-old Los Angeles nurse can hardly believe she's alive. She saw plenty of dead and dying people on her flight from the massacre on the Las Vegas Strip. She even had to walk on some of them to get to a fence that she somehow was able to jump before hunkering down with a group of strangers, waiting for the seemingly endless gunfire to stop. \r\nVanderstay is hospitalized in the University Medical Center in Las Vegas.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/dd65eba30edb33beca5af0b01287569a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
