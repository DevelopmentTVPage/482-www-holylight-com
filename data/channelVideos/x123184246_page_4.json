Everybody in this select preview audience is wearing smart glasses which caption the actresses' lines through augmented reality. \r\nComing to experience the new technology for the first time is Ruth Wilkinson who has moderate hearing loss, she has to use lip-reading and hearing aids to understand conversations.\r\nShe is also a big fan of the theatre, but sometimes struggles to enjoy her passion because of her hearing loss.\r\n\"Often when I'm wearing my hearing aids I'm battling against background noise, so when I'm in a theatre unless it's deadly silent and the person next to me isn't rustling I have to contend with that and my hearing aids don't know whether I want to listen to the conversation or the rustling. So it can be quite difficult,\" she says.\r\nWilkinson says although captioned performances are available they are far fewer and often at matinees, meaning it's harder to get to see a performance with friends. \r\nWilkinson works for the charity Action on Hearing Loss, which has been helping people with hearing loss for more than 100 years.\r\nIt is impossible for a camera to see the captions, which are projected on the tiny lenses just millimetres away from the users' eyes, but they seemingly float in augmented reality about the actresses on stage.\r\nShe was impressed by what she's seen today and says: \"I think it's a fantastic technology. To be able to see theatre with subtitles, at any time, and to be able to watch a performance and have the subtitles going right next to the actor is great. It's a new technology, there's a slight delay, but I'm sure that's something they can improve on. I think it's a fantastic way of making theatre accessible to people who are deaf and have hearing loss.\"\r\nIn the UK it is estimated that 11 million people are affected by some degree of hearing loss, but as the population gets older it is estimated that by 2035 as many as one in five could be living with hearing loss.\r\nThere are currently 900,000 people in the UK with severe or profound hearing loss, meaning they can hear little or nothing at all. \r\nThe National Theatre wants to make every performance accessible for people with hearing loss and it hopes this new technology can help.\r\nJonathan Suffolk is technical director of the National Theatre and explains the advantages of the new system over previous solutions, which involved a static caption screen at the side, or above, the stage.\r\nHe says: \"You can sit anywhere in the auditorium, you don't have to sit within line of sight of the captioning screen, so you can choose to come with friends, with family, sit anywhere, and come to any performance. That's the significant and transformative nature of this project.\"\r\nThe National Theatre aims to have every performance at its three auditoriums available with always-on smart caption technology by October next year.\r\nSuffolk adds: \"I think with caption performances we offer three or four per run of a production and I think it's our obligation to offer hard of hearing users the opportunity to come to any one of the performances, it's giving choice back to people who don't necessarily have it.\"\r\nThe technology powering the system is called Open Access Smart Capture which is delivered to Epson's latest Moverio BT 350 smart glasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6e2041fb2c20d9da140b747f274cf5be \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
