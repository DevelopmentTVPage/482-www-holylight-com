            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker both said Cuban intelligence agencies have the ability to figure out who is behind the unexplained attacks on American diplomats in Havana, given Cuban society is heavily monitored. \r\n\"The idea that in a place like that, Americans could be severely injured and the Cuban government not know who did it is absurd,\" Sen. Rubio said. \r\nThe Senators, along with other members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, were briefed by officials from the State Department in a closed hearing on Wednesday. \r\nThe United States expelled 15 of Cuba's diplomats on Tuesday to protest its failure to protect Americans from the unexplained attacks, plunging diplomatic ties between the countries to levels unseen in years.\r\nOnly days ago, the U.S. and Cuba maintained dozens of diplomats in newly re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington, powerful symbols of a warming relationship between longtime foes. Now both countries are poised to cut their embassies by more than half, as invisible, unexplained attacks threaten delicate relations between the Cold War rivals.\r\nThe State Department gave Cuba's ambassador a list Tuesday of 15 names and ordered them out within one week, officials said, in a move that aims to \"ensure equity\" between each nation's embassy staffing. Last week, the U.S. announced it was withdrawing 60 percent of its own diplomats from Havana because they might be attacked and harmed if they stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/2b8e1e90ee167275f60a074554fa8ac6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Stephen Paddock had at least a dozen rifles fitted with \"bump stocks\" that allowed them to legally mimic the rapid fire of a fully automatic machine gun. And with the target-rich environment outside the Mandalay Bay casino in  Las Vegas Sunday, former Army Ranger Frankie McRae says accuracy was unimportant.\r\nMcRae is owner of 37 PSR Gun Club near Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He has a license to own and fire fully automatic machine guns.\r\nHe doesn't like bump stocks because they make a rifle less accurate. They work by replacing the gun's factory stock with a device that slides back and forth as the gun fires. The recoil \"bumps\" the finger against the trigger after each shot, which means it is still firing like a semi-automatic rifle.\r\nBecause Paddock was firing from an elevated position into a crowded concert, he didn't need to be accurate.\r\n\"The inaccuracy of it really had nothing to do with that,\" McRae says. \"It was a kill box that he had already defined and had used different positions to cover better.\"\r\nThere has been talk for years about banning these devices. McRae doesn't see that as a solution.\r\n\" I'm a constitutionalist. And the Second Amendment says it shall not be infringed. And the word `infringe' means by banning parts on firearms actually is against the Constitution,\" he says.\r\n\"You know, either way, you know, a hammer could kill people, just like a gun can kill people, just like a car has been used to kill people,\" adds McRae. \"You look in France. They killed 89 people, driving down the street.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a346fb6d5e2d56cfbd14a145c4926a9c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Stephen Paddock had at least a dozen rifles fitted with \"bump stocks\" that allowed them to legally mimic the rapid fire of a fully automatic machine gun. And with the target-rich environment outside the Mandalay Bay casino in  Las Vegas Sunday, former Army Ranger Frankie McRae says accuracy was unimportant.\r\nMcRae is owner of 37 PSR Gun Club near Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He has a license to own and fire fully automatic machine guns.\r\nHe doesn't like bump stocks because they make a rifle less accurate. They work by replacing the gun's factory stock with a device that slides back and forth as the gun fires. The recoil \"bumps\" the finger against the trigger after each shot, which means it is still firing like a semi-automatic rifle.\r\nBecause Paddock was firing from an elevated position into a crowded concert, he didn't need to be accurate.\r\n\"The inaccuracy of it really had nothing to do with that,\" McRae says. \"It was a kill box that he had already defined and had used different positions to cover better.\"\r\nThere has been talk for years about banning these devices. McRae doesn't see that as a solution.\r\n\" I'm a constitutionalist. And the Second Amendment says it shall not be infringed. And the word `infringe' means by banning parts on firearms actually is against the Constitution,\" he says.\r\n\"You know, either way, you know, a hammer could kill people, just like a gun can kill people, just like a car has been used to kill people,\" adds McRae. \"You look in France. They killed 89 people, driving down the street.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/a346fb6d5e2d56cfbd14a145c4926a9c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Leaders of the Senate intelligence committee said Wednesday that they have not determined roughly nine months into their investigation whether Russia coordinated with the Trump campaign to sway the 2016 presidential election.\r\n\"The issue of collusion is still open,\" said the Republican committee chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, who along with the panel's top Democrat, Sen. Mark Warner, provided an update on a congressional investigation that was launched the same month as President Donald Trump was inaugurated.\r\nMore than 100 witnesses have been interviewed - including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner - and more than 100,000 pages of documents have been reviewed, Burr said.\r\nThe lawmakers said that though they have reached no conclusion about whether the campaign colluded with the Kremlin - the question also at the heart of a separate criminal investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller - their investigation has left no doubt about a multi-pronged Russian effort to meddle in American politics.\r\n\"The Russian intelligence service is determined, clever and I recommend every campaign and every elected official take this seriously,\" Burr said.\r\nWarner later added that there was a \"large consensus\" that Russians had hacked into political files and strategically released them with the goal of influencing the election.
