He had everything. All the criteria was taken care of. So there was no immediate red flag up.\"\r\nAs he spoke, customers came in and out of the store. Peddle and his staff remembered all of them regardless of how long ago they had been in to shop. He asked one woman about her daughter's wedding and how the catering had gone. Peddle's bulldogs wander the store freely. Woody, his 11-month-old puppy greeted every customer Wednesday.\r\n\"We know everyone who comes in. It's just the kind of store we are.

I sent her photos of her playing with them to her phone.\"\r\nPeddle said Paddock asked questions during that 2016 visit, but did not make any purchases. \r\nHe said he asked about \"Trigger pulls\" and modifications he could make to his guns. Peddle said trigger pulls are used to lighten the spring on triggers.\r\nHe said the couple were very kind to each other, noting that Danley was walking with a \"tricked out\" cane with bedazzling on it because of a surgery. Peddle remembered Paddock walking her to the car and helping her get up.\r\n\"He was very charismatic with her, very sweet. That's the word I would use,\" he said. \"I didn't sense any tension. She couldn't really care at all about the guns. We could have been selling furniture and she wouldn't have cared. She was just in love with our puppies.\"\r\nPeddle said the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms came to get his sales records Tuesday. \r\nHe said he didn't have the surveillance footage from 2016 because ATF had previously collected that footage for its investigation into the July 7 Dallas sniper attack.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/3da8817c159dde5627653d644bb13f46 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

                "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham and Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin joined a gathering of more than 100 'Dreamers' at the U.S. Capitol to push for the senators' bipartisan legislation to protect DACA recipients. \r\n\"I've never seen more bipartisan support for the idea than than right this moment. The American people have heard you. They share your dream and overwhelmingly support your dream,\" said Graham.\r\n\"What you represent are people who can bring real value to America make it a better place, \" Durbin said. \"Lindsey is right in saying that we are poised to do the right thing as a nation and you are going to be the reason,\" he said.\r\nSeveral \"Dreamers\" also spoke at the event.\r\n\"The Dream Act is not controversial.
