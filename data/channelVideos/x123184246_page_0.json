                "description": "(27 Sep 2017) At least five civilians were wounded when several rockets were fired toward Kabul international airport in the Afghan capital, officials said Wednesday.\r\nThe attack that came as US Secretary of Defense James Mattis and NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg were in town for a visit.\r\nNajib Danish, spokesman for the Afghan Interior Ministry, said one rocket stuck a home near the airport, wounding the five victims. \r\nHe said one victim was a woman who was \"not in a good health condition\".\r\nZabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, claimed responsibility for the attack on his official Twitter account.\r\nDanish said Afghan security forces surrounded an area where where they suspected the rockets might have been fired.\r\nTumor Shah Hamedi, director of Kabul airport, said all flights were halted as result of the attack.\r\nA doctor at the Wazir Akbar Khan hospital said they had received four wounded people including two children.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/7f5b63994b769c7d3b1da61c9d6d758a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

He said the worst problems were on Hatteras Island, where more than 10,000 visitors left under an evacuation order, but hundreds of local residents were allowed to stay.\r\nThe National Hurricane Center said an Air Force Reserve reconnaissance aircraft measured Maria's top sustained winds at near 75 mph (120 kmh), with higher gusts. Its center was about 165 miles (265 kilometers) off Cape Hatteras at 11 a.m.\r\nWhile Maria's most punishing hurricane-force winds remained offshore, tropical storm-force winds extended for as much as 230 miles (370 kilometers) from the center, churning up the surf on both sides of the islands. The hurricane's forward speed is just 6 mph (9 kph), so the storm was lingering before swinging out to sea.\r\nOn Hatteras, a fine rain fell Wednesday, with patches of blue sky occasionally showing through. Police set up a check point to block all traffic except for residents and reporters.

SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"I believe that we need to check our facts before we make statements.\" \r\n3. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well it worries me that people play with facts and produce alternative facts.\"\r\n5. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well I believe it is an insult to the entire Iranian nation and shows that the hollow empathy that he tried to show for the Iranian people is indeed hollow and not to be taken seriously and certainly the Iranians don't take that seriously.\"\r\n6. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n7. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"It is unfortunate that for irrelevant political reasons the President of the United States decides to alienate an entire nation and antagonize an entire nation who have not harmed anybody.\"\r\n8. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n9. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well you see, first of all it is not just Iran that is rejecting renegotiation. I think it was the unanimous view of all who negotiated the nuclear deal that renegotiation of this deal is impossible. It would open a Pandora's box.\"\r\n10. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n11. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"The message that the United States is sending to the world that whenever you negotiate with the United States whatever you agree in the course of the negotiations they take for granted and then they come back to you in 5 months, in 6 months, in a year, in two years to ask for whatever they could not get in the first round. This is not a good message to send to the world, this will prove that the United States is not a reliable negotiating partner and for a power like the United States to prove to the world that it is not a reliable negotiating partner is not good for international peace and security.\"\r\n12. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n13. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"It took us 10 years of posturing on all sides and two years of serious negotiation to reach this deal, I don't expect that a new round will produce any better results, in fact a new round will get us in a quagmire that nobody will be able to get out of.\"\r\n14. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n15.

SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well I believe it is an insult to the entire Iranian nation and shows that the hollow empathy that he tried to show for the Iranian people is indeed hollow and not to be taken seriously and certainly the Iranians don't take that seriously.\"\r\n6.

SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"Well you see, first of all it is not just Iran that is rejecting renegotiation.

Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif during interview\r\n11. SOUNDBITE (English) Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iranian Foreign Minister:\r\n\"The message that the United States is sending to the world that whenever you negotiate with the United States whatever you agree in the course of the negotiations they take for granted and then they come back to you in 5 months, in 6 months, in a year, in two years to ask for whatever they could not get in the first round. This is not a good message to send to the world, this will prove that the United States is not a reliable negotiating partner and for a power like the United States to prove to the world that it is not a reliable negotiating partner is not good for international peace and security.\"\r\n12.

            "description": "(27 Sep 2017) LEAD IN:\r\nAn exhibition showcasing the four finalists of the \"Prize of the National Gallery\" has opened in Berlin.\r\nThe prize is one of Germany's most prestigious art accolades. \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nWelcome to the Amazonas Shopping Centre.\r\nYou won't be able to buy anything here, it's an art installation by Berlin-based Venezuelan artist Sol Caleron.\r\nThe work doesn't recreate shopping centres found in Caleron's native Caracas, instead, the 35-year old artist is exploring the spaces that immigrants create for themselves in Europe.\r\nThe colourful shopping centre has a hair salon, a currency exchange booth, an internet cafe and even a small cinema.\r\nIt's based on a real shopping complex, also called the Amazonas Shopping Centre, that Caleron visited in London.\r\nCaleron has been living in Europe since she was 17. She says she has struggled to balance her identity with the need to integrate into a new society. \r\nThis is something that is reflected in her work.\r\n\"No matter how much you do to integrate, it is always never enough. And while you are doing that, trying to integrate into a new society, you are also losing a lot of your own identity. So it became a point where I was like, not only wanted to understand more of the place where I was coming from, but I also wanted to understand what was my identity as an artist,\" she says.\r\nCaleron is one of four artists shortlisted for the \"Prize of the National Gallery\" - one of Germany's most prestigious art prizes.\r\nThe prize is open to artists that are under 40-years-old and live and work in Germany.\r\nThis year, for the first time, the four shortlisted artists are all women.\r\nAnd none of them are German, reflecting the international art scene of Berlin.\r\nJumana Manna, a Palestinian artist who was born in the US, is showing an installation consisting of a film and oversized objects.\r\nThe film, called \"A Magical Substance Flows Into Me\" traces the dislocation of communities, from the 1930s onwards, in what is now Israel, the West Bank and Gaza.\r\nThe film recreates a radio programme of the time focussing on the music of different communities.\r\nThe artefacts in the installation complement the video, says the 30-year-old Manna.\r\n\"I like to create an environment that considers the space and also the audience's bodies within the space.  So in this exhibition, there is a series called the muscle-based series. It is different forms, kind of androgynous forms of muscles or body fragments that are oversized. Biceps or elbows or fingers. And they are made of plaster and they are hollow. And they connect to the film in the theme of muscle memory. So the film is very much about telling history through the senses and through the muscle memory that is needed to perform music and memorise music over generations.\"\r\nIman Issa is a Berlin-based, Egyptian artist.\r\nIn her exhibition, artefacts that she has seen in antiquities museums have been carefully recreated using modern materials and techniques.\r\nThe objects look new, but at the same time, the viewer gets the sense that they belong to another time. Or maybe it is that the original objects belong to our time, says Issa.\r\n\"The project came from, maybe started around 2011 or 2012 in terms of thinking. And it was based on a feeling of going around antiquities museums and having a sense that the objects there spoke in a way that I don't remember from before. And that they had a very strange presence that didn't seem to belong to the past, but seemed quite relevant to the present.\"\r\nAgnieszka Polska is a Polish artist based in Berlin.\r\nHer video installation deals with what she calls the \"disaster\" happening to the world.\r\nThe 32-year old artist says all her work is about social responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6cd0e5769294b793b20fc3aa44e8969f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
