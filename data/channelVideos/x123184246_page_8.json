            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) Republican Senators Marco Rubio and Bob Corker both said Cuban intelligence agencies have the ability to figure out who is behind the unexplained attacks on American diplomats in Havana, given Cuban society is heavily monitored. \r\n\"The idea that in a place like that, Americans could be severely injured and the Cuban government not know who did it is absurd,\" Sen. Rubio said. \r\nThe Senators, along with other members of the Senate Foreign Relations committee, were briefed by officials from the State Department in a closed hearing on Wednesday. \r\nThe United States expelled 15 of Cuba's diplomats on Tuesday to protest its failure to protect Americans from the unexplained attacks, plunging diplomatic ties between the countries to levels unseen in years.\r\nOnly days ago, the U.S. and Cuba maintained dozens of diplomats in newly re-opened embassies in Havana and Washington, powerful symbols of a warming relationship between longtime foes.

The American people have heard you. They share your dream and overwhelmingly support your dream,\" said Graham.\r\n\"What you represent are people who can bring real value to America make it a better place, \" Durbin said. \"Lindsey is right in saying that we are poised to do the right thing as a nation and you are going to be the reason,\" he said.\r\nSeveral \"Dreamers\" also spoke at the event.\r\n\"The Dream Act is not controversial. The American public is on our side,\" said Maria Praeli, who came to the U.S. from Peru when she was five years old.\"\r\nPresident Donald Trump announced last month he was ending the DACA program and giving Congress six months to come up with a fix. \r\nThe president has suggested he could revisit the issue if Congress doesn't come up with a solution in time, but administration officials testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee Tuesday said that immigrants' temporary work permits would begin to expire absent congressional action, and they would become subject to deportation.\r\nWednesday's event took place as senators convened their first hearing on the topic since Trump announced he was winding down DACA, which Republicans have long denounced as an unconstitutional overreach by President Barack Obama.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/4c78c10e24af784c763f76a7313b0141 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
