Everybody in this select preview audience is wearing smart glasses which caption the actresses' lines through augmented reality. \r\nComing to experience the new technology for the first time is Ruth Wilkinson who has moderate hearing loss, she has to use lip-reading and hearing aids to understand conversations.\r\nShe is also a big fan of the theatre, but sometimes struggles to enjoy her passion because of her hearing loss.\r\n\"Often when I'm wearing my hearing aids I'm battling against background noise, so when I'm in a theatre unless it's deadly silent and the person next to me isn't rustling I have to contend with that and my hearing aids don't know whether I want to listen to the conversation or the rustling. So it can be quite difficult,\" she says.\r\nWilkinson says although captioned performances are available they are far fewer and often at matinees, meaning it's harder to get to see a performance with friends. \r\nWilkinson works for the charity Action on Hearing Loss, which has been helping people with hearing loss for more than 100 years.\r\nIt is impossible for a camera to see the captions, which are projected on the tiny lenses just millimetres away from the users' eyes, but they seemingly float in augmented reality about the actresses on stage.\r\nShe was impressed by what she's seen today and says: \"I think it's a fantastic technology. To be able to see theatre with subtitles, at any time, and to be able to watch a performance and have the subtitles going right next to the actor is great. It's a new technology, there's a slight delay, but I'm sure that's something they can improve on. I think it's a fantastic way of making theatre accessible to people who are deaf and have hearing loss.\"\r\nIn the UK it is estimated that 11 million people are affected by some degree of hearing loss, but as the population gets older it is estimated that by 2035 as many as one in five could be living with hearing loss.\r\nThere are currently 900,000 people in the UK with severe or profound hearing loss, meaning they can hear little or nothing at all. \r\nThe National Theatre wants to make every performance accessible for people with hearing loss and it hopes this new technology can help.\r\nJonathan Suffolk is technical director of the National Theatre and explains the advantages of the new system over previous solutions, which involved a static caption screen at the side, or above, the stage.\r\nHe says: \"You can sit anywhere in the auditorium, you don't have to sit within line of sight of the captioning screen, so you can choose to come with friends, with family, sit anywhere, and come to any performance. That's the significant and transformative nature of this project.\"\r\nThe National Theatre aims to have every performance at its three auditoriums available with always-on smart caption technology by October next year.\r\nSuffolk adds: \"I think with caption performances we offer three or four per run of a production and I think it's our obligation to offer hard of hearing users the opportunity to come to any one of the performances, it's giving choice back to people who don't necessarily have it.\"\r\nThe technology powering the system is called Open Access Smart Capture which is delivered to Epson's latest Moverio BT 350 smart glasses.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/6e2041fb2c20d9da140b747f274cf5be \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nJordan has called on Israel to launch a proper legal inquiry into a fatal shooting in which an Israeli security guard killed two Jordanian civilians.\r\nIsrael called the shooting self defence but the incident has created a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.\r\n\r\nSTRORYLINE:\r\nOn most days, Zakariya al-Jawawdeh visits the grave of his 16-year-old son Mohammed, watering plants and reciting a prayer. Each trip to the cemetery, a few steps from his home in Jordan's capital, Amman, also stokes frustration that his son's killer, an Israeli security guard, has not yet been held accountable.\r\nThe furniture store owner's grievances are entangled in one of the most toxic diplomatic crises since Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994.\r\nAccording to a Jordanian official the relationship - typically low-key, but strategically important - has been \"hit hard\" on all levels by the shooting on 23 July 2017 at Israel's embassy in Jordan. The Israeli guard behind the attack also killed his middle-aged Jordanian landlord. \r\nZakariya al-Jawawdeh is demanding justice for his son:\r\n\"This is a sovereign country and has its ruling system and has its law, so the law must be implemented, not only for my sake, this is for the sake of all Jordanians, and for all Jordanians not to feel weak and not to say that Jordanians are losing their rights in their own country,\" he says.\r\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry, which says the guard acted in self defence after the teen attacked him with a screw driver, declined comment on potential damage to the relationship. \r\nSpokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said Israel will share the eventual results of an ongoing investigation with Jordan, but would not describe the type of inquiry under way.\r\nCore elements of the relationship have survived.\r\nSecurity cooperation continues against shared enemies, such as Islamic extremist groups, but at a reduced level, said the Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid a further escalation of tensions. But other endeavours, such as a the third phase of a programme to employ Jordanians in Israeli hotels and conference on water and energy cooperation have suffered.\r\nHamada Faraaneh, a political analyst and former MP says Jordan, is unlikely to back down until the Israeli security guard is put on legal and public trial and his victims' families are compensated:\r\n\"I don't think Jordan will show any signs of retreat or slack, because this case has transformed into a public case and it can not be tolerated in this regard, especially the continuous Israeli policy in settlements, failure to comply with the terms of settlement. I think this is the prime and substantial reason that these factors create more tension,\" he says. \r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been assigned much of the blame for the diplomatic crisis due to his handling of the shooting aftermath.\r\nThe shooting came at a time of tensions over a Muslim-administered Jerusalem holy site that is revered by Muslims and Jews. \r\nThe day after the shooting, after a phone call between Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah II, Jordan allowed the guard to leave under the cover of diplomatic immunity, while Israel removed metal detectors at the holy site in an apparent tradeoff.\r\nBut two days after the fatal shooting, Netanyahu praised the guard in a hero's welcome at the prime minister's office. Netanyahu told the guard he had acted \"calmly\" and he was \"happy that things ended the way they did\".\r\nJordan's monarch promptly slammed Netanyahu for \"provocative\" behaviour, accusing him of trying to score political points in Israel, where the prime minister was being criticised for his handling of the metal detector controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/736fd4268ea1be20a5562aed3484cf94 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
