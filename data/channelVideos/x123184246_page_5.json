            "description": "(4 Oct 2017) LEADIN:\r\nJordan has called on Israel to launch a proper legal inquiry into a fatal shooting in which an Israeli security guard killed two Jordanian civilians.\r\nIsrael called the shooting self defence but the incident has created a diplomatic crisis between the two countries.\r\n\r\nSTRORYLINE:\r\nOn most days, Zakariya al-Jawawdeh visits the grave of his 16-year-old son Mohammed, watering plants and reciting a prayer. Each trip to the cemetery, a few steps from his home in Jordan's capital, Amman, also stokes frustration that his son's killer, an Israeli security guard, has not yet been held accountable.\r\nThe furniture store owner's grievances are entangled in one of the most toxic diplomatic crises since Israel and Jordan signed a peace treaty in 1994.\r\nAccording to a Jordanian official the relationship - typically low-key, but strategically important - has been \"hit hard\" on all levels by the shooting on 23 July 2017 at Israel's embassy in Jordan. The Israeli guard behind the attack also killed his middle-aged Jordanian landlord. \r\nZakariya al-Jawawdeh is demanding justice for his son:\r\n\"This is a sovereign country and has its ruling system and has its law, so the law must be implemented, not only for my sake, this is for the sake of all Jordanians, and for all Jordanians not to feel weak and not to say that Jordanians are losing their rights in their own country,\" he says.\r\nIsrael's Foreign Ministry, which says the guard acted in self defence after the teen attacked him with a screw driver, declined comment on potential damage to the relationship. \r\nSpokesman Emmanuel Nahshon said Israel will share the eventual results of an ongoing investigation with Jordan, but would not describe the type of inquiry under way.\r\nCore elements of the relationship have survived.\r\nSecurity cooperation continues against shared enemies, such as Islamic extremist groups, but at a reduced level, said the Jordanian official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to avoid a further escalation of tensions. But other endeavours, such as a the third phase of a programme to employ Jordanians in Israeli hotels and conference on water and energy cooperation have suffered.\r\nHamada Faraaneh, a political analyst and former MP says Jordan, is unlikely to back down until the Israeli security guard is put on legal and public trial and his victims' families are compensated:\r\n\"I don't think Jordan will show any signs of retreat or slack, because this case has transformed into a public case and it can not be tolerated in this regard, especially the continuous Israeli policy in settlements, failure to comply with the terms of settlement. I think this is the prime and substantial reason that these factors create more tension,\" he says. \r\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been assigned much of the blame for the diplomatic crisis due to his handling of the shooting aftermath.\r\nThe shooting came at a time of tensions over a Muslim-administered Jerusalem holy site that is revered by Muslims and Jews. \r\nThe day after the shooting, after a phone call between Netanyahu and Jordan's King Abdullah II, Jordan allowed the guard to leave under the cover of diplomatic immunity, while Israel removed metal detectors at the holy site in an apparent tradeoff.\r\nBut two days after the fatal shooting, Netanyahu praised the guard in a hero's welcome at the prime minister's office. Netanyahu told the guard he had acted \"calmly\" and he was \"happy that things ended the way they did\".\r\nJordan's monarch promptly slammed Netanyahu for \"provocative\" behaviour, accusing him of trying to score political points in Israel, where the prime minister was being criticised for his handling of the metal detector controversy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/736fd4268ea1be20a5562aed3484cf94 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",

Dianne Feinstein, who has long expressed concern over the availability of such accessories, said Tuesday that Las Vegas shooter Stephen Paddock modified at least one of his weapons with a bump stock device, but she did not elaborate.\r\nA semi-automatic weapon requires one trigger pull for each round fired. With a fully automatic firearm, one trigger pull can unleash continuous rounds until the magazine is empty. The bump-stock devices work by manipulating the trigger mechanism extremely rapidly, far faster than a person could do so without them.\r\nAuthorities found two bump stocks in Paddock's hotel room, two officials familiar with the investigation told The Associated Press. \r\nThey are investigating whether those items were used to modify weapons used in the massacre, according to the officials, who were briefed by law enforcement and spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is still unfolding. Sheriff Joseph Lombardo hasn't said whether they played a role in the rampage.\r\nAuthorities say Paddock opened fire from the windows of his 32nd floor hotel room late Sunday, killing 59 people and wounding hundreds more at a country music festival. Police stormed his room and found he had killed himself after committing the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history.\r\nWitnesses and law enforcement official said the quick, 50-round bursts of gunfire raised the possibility that Paddock had used a fully automatic weapon or modified his semi-automatic rifles to function like one. Paddock had 23 guns in his hotel room.\r\nYet the purchasing of fully automatic weapons has been significantly restricted in the U.S. since the 1930s.\r\nIn 1986, the federal National Firearms Act was amended further to prohibit the transfer or possession of machine guns by civilians, with an exception for those previously manufactured and registered.\r\nNumerous attempts to design retrofits failed until recent years when bump stocks came on the market.\r\nThe device basically replaces the gun's shoulder rest, with a \"support step\" that covers the trigger opening. By holding the pistol grip with one hand and pushing forward on the barrel with the other, the shooter's finger comes in contact with the trigger. The recoil causes the gun to buck back and forth, \"bumping\" the trigger.\r\nTechnically, that means the finger is pulling the trigger for each round fired, keeping the weapon a legal semi-automatic.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/metadata\/youtube\/22af52cb692a451d9f6d669b86be215b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http:\/\/www.aparchive.com\/HowWeWork",
